>> Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication Point Contact Solver for MATLAB
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the theory presented in Venner and Lubrecht's book "Multilevel Methods in Lubrication", with the following modifications:
- Fourier Transforms are used to calculate deformation instead of the Multi-Level Multi-Integration mentioned in the book
- An option to execute the solver using the GPU is added

Examples are provided in the +examples folder. To run them, you must be in the project root folder (i.e. where this README is). From there, you can run examples from the examples namespace. E.g. from the command window in the root folder:

CPU Examples:
>> examples.ex1
>> examples.ex2
>> examples.ex3
>> examples.ex4
>> examples.ex5
>> examples.ex6

GPU Examples:
>> examples.ex7
>> examples.ex8
>> examples.ex9

Note on GPU support (Windows): Build mex using the .\make-mex.bat script provided in the +utils folder. The mex file currently uses C++17, which needs a newer version of MATLAB than R2021b. So mexcuda can not be used and a local install of CUDA >= 11.2 must be provided. To build, a $MATLABROOT environment variable must be available, and for windows, the MSVC build environment must be initialised via the MSVS developer command prompt. If the environment is set correctly, the mex file will build automatically as part of the solution process.

Note on GPU support (Linux): Build mex using the ./make-mex.sh script provided in the +utils folder. The mex file currently uses C++17, which needs a newer version of MATLAB than R2021b. So mexcuda can not be used and a local install of CUDA >= 11.2 must be provided. If the variables required by the script are set correctly, the mex file will build automatically as part of the solution process.

Variable naming conventions are kept similar to those used in "Multilevel Methods in Lubrication".
