>> Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication Point Contact Solver for MATLAB
-----------------------------------------------------------------

EHL point contact solver based on the theory presented in Venner and Lubrecht's book "Multigrid Methods for EHL", specifically chapter 6 (Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication), with the following modifications:
- Fourier Transforms are used to calculate deformation instead of the Multi-Level Multi-Integration mentioned in the book
- The solution method is adapated to accomodate efficient execution on the GPU
