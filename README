>> Elastohydrodynamic Lubrication Point Contact Solver for MATLAB
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the theory presented in Venner and Lubrecht's book "Multilevel Methods in Lubrication", with the following modifications:
- Fourier Transforms are used to calculate deformation instead of the Multi-Level Multi-Integration mentioned in the book
- An option to execute the solver using the GPU is added
